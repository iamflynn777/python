I am a newbie in python. I am stuck by finding the length of a path in 2d. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. Please help!

import math
vector1 = v1
vector2 = v2
def length (v):

    """ Length of a vector in 2-space.

    Params: v (2-tuple) vector in 2-space
    Returns: (float) length
    """
    v = sqrt(v1**2 + v2**2)
    return v



def dist (P,Q):

    """ Distance in 2-space.

    Params: 
        P (2-tuple): a point in 2-space
        Q (2-tuple): another point in 2-space
    Returns: (float) dist (P,Q)
    """
    dist = [(Q - P) **2]
    dist = math.sqrt(sum(dist))
    return dist


P = [p0, p1]
Q = [q0, q1]
def pathLength2d (pt):

    """Length of a 2-dimensional path.

    Standard length as measured by a ruler.

    Params: pt (list of 2-tuples): path in 2-space

    Returns: (float) length of this path
    """
    pt = math.hypot(q0 - p0, q1 -p1)
    return pt

print (pathLength2d ([(0,0), (1,1)]))
